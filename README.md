# LeetCode Python Journey - Master Learning Tracker

**Goal**: Master problem-solving in Python through consistent daily practice with deep conceptual understanding and progressive optimization.

**Started**: January 1, 2026

## Day-by-Day Progress

### Day 1: January 1, 2026 - Arrays & Hash Maps Fundamentals

**Main Problem**:
- [LeetCode #1: Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

**Related Problems** (for future reinforcement):
- *N/A - First day*

**Topics Covered**:
- Hash Maps / Dictionaries in Python
- Trade-off between time and space complexity
- Two-pointer and lookup optimization
- Common pitfalls with duplicates and edge cases

**Key Concepts Learned**:
- Using dictionaries for O(1) lookups
- Why brute force O(n²) fails at scale
- Space-time complexity trade-offs

**Mistakes Made**:
- *To be filled in after attempting*

**Optimization Techniques Discovered**:
- *To be filled in after coding*

**Personal Notes**:
- Starting with the classic "Two Sum" problem because it teaches hash maps, which are fundamental to many algorithms
- Will use this as a foundation for future array/dictionary problems

### Day 2: January 2, 2026 - Prefix Sums + Hash Maps

**Main Problem**:
- [LeetCode #560: Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)

**Related Problems** (reinforcement from previous day):
- Re-run Day 1: Two Sum (hash map focus)
- Two Sum with negatives and zeros (practice edge handling)
- Two Sum brute-force vs hash map (complexity contrast)

**Topics Covered**:
- Prefix sums for subarray queries
- Hash map frequency counting of prefixes
- Handling negatives (why sliding window fails here)

**Key Concepts Learned**:
- For each prefix `p`, subarrays ending here with sum `k` equal count of `p - k`
- Initialize prefix frequency with `{0:1}` to count subarrays starting at index 0
- Time/space trade-offs between brute force O(n²) and prefix-hash O(n)

**Mistakes Made**:
- *To be filled in after attempting*

**Optimization Techniques Discovered**:
- Prefix-sum counting in one pass with a hash map

**Personal Notes**:
- Sliding window is not reliable when negatives exist; prefix sums remain stable
